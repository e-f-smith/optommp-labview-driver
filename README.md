# Overview

The OptoMMP Driver for LabVIEW enables LabVIEW programs to communicate with Opto22 devices, such as SNAP-
PAC industrial monitoring and control systems, using the Opto22 Memory Mapped Protocol (OptoMMP).

The OptoMMP Driver for LabVIEW was developed at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and is now maintained
here as open-source software. 

## User Guide

To use the OptoMMP Driver for LabVIEW, copy the `OptoMMP` folder and its contents into your LabVIEW `instr.lib`
folder. It may be necessary to make changes in `Tools` -> `Advanced` -> `Edit Palette Set` to make the 
subpalette appear under `Instrument I/O` -> `Instr Drivers`.
